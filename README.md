# Wordle

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

A game similar to [Wordle](https://www.nytimes.com/games/wordle/index.html), except where words can be between 2 and 5 characters long.

You may also additionally guess the word by using its line number in the `wordlist.txt`, served up in `/public`.

- e.g. specifying `16117` in the answer specifier field should set the answer to `ocean`.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.
